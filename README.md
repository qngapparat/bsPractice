# bsPractice
Practising IPC in C, including pipes, signals, shared memory and semaphores.
Filenames: r = read, w = write, rcv = receive, snd = send.

## Inter-Process Communication
**simple_pipe.c**
create am unnamed pipe between related processes used to send string.

**anon_pipe.c and anon_pipe_dual.c**
create one (anon_pipe.c) or two (anon_pipe_dual.c) unnamed pipes between related processes executing shell programs. anon_pipe_dual.c doesn't execute anything, it simply demonstrates two-way communication.

**popen_r.c and popen_w.c**
execute shell programs using popen() and pclose() which write to / read from a FILE*
popen_r.c illustrates how to read from the FILE*, where the stdout of "ls -l" is saved. Data is piped from stdout of the shell program to FILE*.
popen_r.c illustrates how to write to the FILE*, where "grep <keyword>" is waiting for stdin. Data is piped from FILE* to stdin of the shell programm.

**sig.c**
sending, catching and handling signals (SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2 and SIGINT) between multiple processes.

**logging_service.c with chatter_1.c thru chatter_3.c**
three "chatters" creating a fifos to they each write strings. logging_service.c watches all three using select(), and prints messages of all three fifos.

### System V
**msg_recv.c and msg_send.c using System V**
creating a public message queue (char array) to pass informations between processes.

**shm_rcv.c and shm_snd.c using System V**
creating a shared memory segment and writing / reading a string.
*Note:* To signal the sender that the signal was received and the shared memory can be deleted by the sender, the first character is set to " * " by the receiver. The sender waits in a loop until this is the case, and then deletes the segment and terminates.

**sem_r.c and sem_w using System V**
creating a public semaphore and using it to control access to one critical region per program.

### POSIX
**posix_shm.c using POSIX**
using POSIX shared memory to store and change an integer over different processes.

**posix_sem.c using POSIX**
creating a POSIX semaphore and closing it (insert critical section code between sem_open and sem_close).

## Miscellaneous
**queue.c**
a simple array-based integer queue (blueprint) with core functionality (enqueue(), dequeue() and top()).

**heap_array.c**
a working blueprint of a integer min-heap (minimum value on top), with core functionality, namely insert(), removeMin() and bubbleup() and bubbledown() (parts of the former two functions) implemented.

## Incomplete:
**binary_tree.c**
Some functions are already implemented; it is however not yet functional as a whole.
